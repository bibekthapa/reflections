When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to share things publicly and want more than one people to collaborate on work then we use remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

   Forks are used to make repository directly on githubs so that it should not be pulled to local machine and again pushed to github.It helps to know the creator, contributor.Used when consideration is to be given to creator and to save the time.

   Clones are done in order to download the same version from the remote to the local machine.

   Branches are made in order to take risks in the code without fear of messing the original code.This is used when risk has to be taken during the making of the programs
